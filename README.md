This is my personal website, portfolio, blog, and whatever else it might morph into over time. Be sure to check back every now and then. The base design and theme comes from [Strange Case](http://thephuse.github.io/strange_case/), used under the [MIT License] (http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), built by the wonderful folks at [Phuse](http://phuse.ca/). Fonts are Open Sans Extra Bold and Roboto Slab. Content and opinions are all mine and not that of my employers or compatriots unless stated otherwise.
