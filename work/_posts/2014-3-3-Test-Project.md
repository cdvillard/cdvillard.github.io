The Floating Lotus, offering in-office massage services, needed an website designed with fast-moving business owners in mind. Originally hand-coded in HTML and CSS, it was later rebuilt using Twitterâ€™s Bootstrap framework to improve its mobile layout and uses a jQuery plug-in for smooth scrolling. The content is still being developed by the client.
