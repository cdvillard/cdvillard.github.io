## About Charles

I am a self-taught web developer based in southern Miami, Florida with a passion for front-end development, web standards, object-oriented practices, and great phá»Ÿ. I currently work on full-stack development for Tenet Partners.

I began learning to code at the start of 2013 to improve my skill set as a journalism student. Shortly after learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I decided to change gears and pursue web development as my career. It has since become a passion of mine, and I thoroughly enjoy how vast and complex its subject matter is. I consider myself a constant student in that regards, always learning about new methodologies and technologies in my spare time. I borrow this frame of mind from the martial art of jiu jitsu, where despite how many years someone has practiced, they are always a white belt at heart.

<!--These days, I'm taking classes and working towards earning certifications as a Microsoft Certified Solution Associate and Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer. Technologies I'll be working with during this time will include ASP.NET, C#, LINQ, Entity Framework, and Razor.-->

Languages and frameworks I've had the opportunity to professionally work with include:
XHTML, HTML5, CSS2 and CSS3, JavaScript (ECMAScript 5 specification), jQuery, AJAX, PHP, WordPress, and MySQL.

Languages and frameworks I've messed with in my spare time include:
Ruby on Rails, Jekyll, SASS, and Angular.
